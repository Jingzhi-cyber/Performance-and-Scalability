1. The XML parser library we used assume that the given string contains a valid XML file with valid format. 
    The server will work perfectly when client giving right requests.
    However, if a client sends one request with invalid XML format, e.g. using <symbol my_sym="SPY"> rather than <symbol sym="SPY">, 
    the server can not read the given symbol by looking for an attribute named "sym" and thus can not return the correct response to the client.

1. Handled the error on 03/31. Now if the attribute name of one node is invalid, the server will send back a response with an error node.

1. If a client with an valid account_id wants to query a transcation that does not belong to him/her, the server will execute the query 
    and return the status of the transcation.

1. Handled the error on 04/03 by checking whether the given trans_id is belong to the account_id. If it is not belong to the account_id, then return an error node.

1. We assume that the given values sent by the client valid, e,g, balance = 5000. If the given balance = -5000, the database will report an error when trying to insert the value, 
    and the server may not return the correct response. 
2. If there are too many clients trying to connect to the server and perform request, e.g. over 900 clients, some client's connection to the server may be failed.
